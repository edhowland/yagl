This is the experimental branch
This is also the event branch of the experimental branch

To run:
  to create the initial intermediate yagl:
  alias r='ruby -I../../lib'
  r ../../bin/yagl_boot 
  
  that should create bin/yagl
  
  r bin/yagl agem
  
  that should create agem/bin/yagl along with agem/lib/n.ygl
  
  cd agem
  alias rr='ruby -I../../../lib'
  rm -rd dest; rr bin/yagl dest
  
  This should copy template/** to dest
  
  ----------
  Notes:
  
  The first call of the intermediate new/bin/yagl should create agem/bin/agem
  In order to make that happen, when reading the templates dir, if it finds a file named _target.eruby, it should repalace it with the target name, in this case agem.
  
  To edit what happens in the final target script. edit new/lib/scripts/*.ygl
  
  This event branch relies on the event-engine gem, which must be installed, or added to the load path if using its source.
  
  Change over to: r bin/yagl final
  This should generate the final yagl based on final Yaglfile and lib/scripts/*.ygl
  
  Move agem to there and :
  alias rrr='ruby -I../../../../lib'
  # copy lib/scripts/*.ygl to final/lib/scripts
  # need final/lib/scripts/lib.ygl with vputs, qputs
  cd final
  rr bin/yagl omega
  cd omega
  rrr bin/yagl dest
  tree dest
  
  omega is the final final yagl that includes the event-engine stuff
  omega/bin/yagl and lib/* need to get copied to root <yagl>
  lib/process_templates.ygl needs to turn _target.eruby into <cmd>
  
  After that works (specs and esp. features pass, then discard tmp/**)
